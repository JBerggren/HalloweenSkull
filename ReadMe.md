# HalloweenSkull   
Project for creating a interactive skull for Halloween with a Raspberry Pi and .Net 5.   
The idea is to use a plastic skull and embed red leds behind the eyes, a servo to control the jaw and a speaker to play spoky laughter on and hook it up to a Raspberry Pi.
Either I will use a battery or have the skull pluged in to electricity. 

## Current progress   
I have the leds, servo and speaker "working". Now need to get a good connection between the jaw and the servo. 

## Ideas for further development   
* Create a webpage hosted on the Pi to remote control it with
* Make it possible to enter text into webpage which will then be spoken by the skull
* Add btn/touch areas on the back of the skull to manually start it

## Misc notes   
Set volume - sudo amixer cset numid=1 100%
